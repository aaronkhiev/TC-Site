    <h3>What is a Table Top game? What is the Fantasy Table Top
        Compendium?</h3>
    <hr />

    <p>
        <strong>Table Top</strong> games refer to any game that can <br>
        be played on any flat surface or "table" like the name suggests. <br>
        <br>
        The <strong>Fantasy Table Top Compendium</strong> is a tool that
        focuses specifically <br>
        on roleplaying table top games such as Dungeons & Dragons 5e to <br>
        Pathfinder. While these games are incredibly rewarding, they also
        have an <br>
        incredibly difficult learning curve and isn't as accessible to <br>
        those just starting out fresh. <br>
        <br>
        The Compendium will help you generate character stats with
        explanations <br>
        for stats, feats, and general character building assistance. This
        tool <br>
        also provides resources for Game Masters (Also known as Dungeon
        Masters) <br>
        to help support encounters, general worldbuilding, and story writing.

        The Table Top Compendium was created as a gateway for creatives to get into table top games <br>
        without having to endure the steep learning curve that comes with it. TTRPGs are heavily gatekept <br>
        either through paywalls or a lack of accessible information about getting started. Through the TC Compendium <br>
        we hope to see more people get involved and really express themselves through the art of character roleplay, worldbuilding, <br>
        and more importanly getting to have fun through this unique game experience. Whether you are an experienced player or new to <br>
        the world of TTRPGs there is something here for you~!
